# Engineering notes: what I got wrong, and what it cost

A running log of the architectural decisions behind this project — including the
ones that were wrong, what they cost, and what replaced them. Written as it
happened, not cleaned up afterwards.

This section documents the real decisions, dead ends and lessons from the project's evolution. The commit history tells you "what changed"; this section answers "why."

### The Beginning: the "Analysis Tool" Era

I actually started the project as a Unity code **analysis** tool. In the first version the user pasted a C# script, the system ran static analysis and returned one big JSON report. Many agents (intent classifier, orchestrator, unity expert, critic, game feel…) ran in sequence.

**The problem:** that pipeline took 45–60 seconds. Even when the user said "rename this variable," all the agents fired.

**Lesson:** an analytical architecture is the wrong paradigm for interactive development. 60 seconds is acceptable for a report; for "fix this" it's lethal.

### The Big Shift: From Analysis Tool to Agentic IDE

This is the project's most critical architectural decision. In the old model the user asked, a one-shot answer came back, and the chat ended — the AI couldn't see working files, read error logs, or touch the terminal.

**What pushed me to it:** the message "error: NullReferenceException at PlayerController.cs:47, fix it." Since the AI couldn't see line 47, it could only give generic advice. What would a senior do? Open the file, read the line, understand the context, fix it.

```
Old model:  User → [single LLM call] → Answer
New model:  User → [LLM] → tool call → [result] → [LLM] → … → Answer
```

`AgentRunner` and `ToolRegistry` are the products of this shift.

### main.py: Refactor Against the God Object

At one point `main.py` reached 2000+ lines — auth, chat, OAuth, analysis, config all in one file. I did a full route refactor:

```
Before:  main.py (2000+ lines)
After:   routes/{auth,conversation,config,analysis,…}_routes.py + main.py (~30-line bootstrap)
```

**Lesson:** "I'll just put it here for now" gets paid back sooner or later. A 2000-line file isn't just code debt, it's cognitive-load debt. (With the same discipline the `ai_providers.py` god object was later split under `providers/`.)

### The MCP Decision: Why a CLI Layer?

A critical choice: should the AI tools run directly through the backend, or through CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini)?

The problem with going direct: rewriting tool calling for every new model, handling each model's different format, rebuilding security boundaries again and again.

The advantage of the CLI approach: these tools **already have** their own tool ecosystem, security layer and MCP support. Positioning as an MCP server on top of them means inheriting each CLI's power.

```
Old:  Frontend → Backend → [my own tool code] → file system
New:  Frontend → Backend → CLI (MCP client) → MCP server → file system
```

**Cost:** managing 3 different CLI config formats (JSON / TOML / JSON) and their behavioral differences.

---

### Gemini's Hidden Tool Collision

I defined a `write_file` tool over MCP. It didn't show up in the Gemini CLI: `Tool 'mcp_..._write_file' not found`. Instead of analyzing logs I asked the CLI directly:
> "Which MCP tools do you see, and is `write_file` in your built-in list?"

The answer: Gemini had a built-in tool named `write_file` and was **silently suppressing** the same-named MCP tool. Renaming it to `save_file` fixed it.

**Lesson:** when debugging CLI tools, the fastest method isn't logs — it's asking the tool itself.

---

### The Stop Button: Seemingly Simple, Actually Two Layers

On "Stop" I cut the SSE with an AbortController — but the backend CLI process kept running, polling for approval. The fix was in two parts:

```typescript
stopMessage: () => {
  abortControllerRef.current?.abort();               // cut the SSE connection
  fetch(`${API}/mcp-abort-all`, { method: 'POST' }); // reject pending approval gates
}
```

**Lesson:** cancellation semantics span multiple layers. "The frontend cancelled" ≠ "the operation cancelled." Every async boundary needs its own cancellation mechanism.

### I Tore Out Auth: From Web Architecture to Local Desktop

By reflex I started with web patterns: bcrypt, JWT, session DB, OAuth2 (Google+GitHub), rate limiting — ~2000 lines, 4 tables, 7 endpoints.

One day I realized: **this is an Electron app.** The user already has physical access to their device. The multi-user layer was offering fake security — an attacker can already reach `app_data/`, the API keys, the file system.

```typescript
const localAppToken = randomUUID()                 // new each launch
spawn(backend, { env: { ...process.env, LOCAL_APP_TOKEN: localAppToken } })
ipcMain.handle('app-token-get', () => localAppToken)
```

The `users` table now has a single row: `(id=1, username='local')`. The sessions/OAuth tables were dropped.

**Result:** ~2000 lines removed, 7 endpoints reduced to stubs, 4 tables gone, pytest 40% faster.

**Lesson:** architecture must fit the application's context. Copying web patterns into a local app only produces technical debt.

### The agy Saga: I Learned the Limits of Embedding a CLI (xD)

The project's biggest dead end. It limped along behind a **warning banner** for a while — until I found the right channel (the `run_command` bridge) and **actually solved it.**

#### Scene 1: "We have 27 days"
I learned Google would retire the Gemini CLI in 27 days; Antigravity (`agy`) was the replacement. The hot-swap looked simple: call `--print`, feed the prompt via stdin, read the output. It looked like a 3-hour job. **It took three days.**

#### Scene 2: "Where are the tool calls?"
agy returned text, but on file-write requests the MCP tools were **never called**. The agy log had a key line: `checkpoint model generated tool calls`. I asked agy and Codex: **`--print` mode blocks tool dispatch by design**, they said.

#### Scene 3: "We'll use `-i` mode!"
They suggested interactive (`-i`) mode instead of `--print`. First attempt:
```
bubbletea: could not open TTY: open /dev/tty: device not configured
```
bubbletea (agy's TUI) refused the PIPE — a real PTY was required.

#### Scene 4: The PTY and Terminal Hijack Disaster
`pty.openpty()`, `termios`, `start_new_session=True` — all by the book. I ran it: agy's TUI (sign-in, spinners, permission prompts) leaked **into the user's terminal**, and the backend could read nothing from stdout. Worse, even `--dangerously-skip-permissions` didn't bypass the native shell prompts in `-i` mode.

#### Scene 5: Research — We're Not Alone
On GitHub, `antigravity-cli` Issue #187 was exactly our problem, with no response from Google. The Gemini API docs said "Antigravity Agent: function_calling and mcp are not yet supported." All three paths were closed.

#### Scene 6: Acceptance and a Banner
I went back to `--print`. agy sometimes wrote files / ran commands — bypassing our approval bridge. The only honest solution: a dismissable yellow banner telling the user.

#### Scene 7: The Fix — "I Was Knocking on the Wrong Door"
The banner held for a few days. Then I asked again: *how does agy use unityMCP?* Because unityMCP **worked** — agy could add GameObjects to the scene. An isolated test gave the answer. agy explained it in its own words:

> "My `read_console` tool is lazily-loaded over an HTTP MCP server; so I wrote a Python script into the workspace and connected to `127.0.0.1:8080/mcp` with `streamable_http_client` to call the tool from there."

**The lightbulb moment.** agy doesn't natively load MCP under `--print` — but it's smart enough: seeing an HTTP MCP URL, it writes **its own bridge script** with `run_command` and connects. So under `--print` the **only real channel agy sees is `run_command`.** I'd been knocking on the wrong door the whole time.

**The solution — the `unityai` CLI bridge:**
1. I wrote `unityai_cli.py` + a `unityai` wrapper. This CLI **shares the same `approval_bridge`** as the MCP tools — a `unityai save-file …` call opens the approval card just like `mcp__unityai__save_file`. agy calls it via `run_command`.
2. I disabled agy's **real** built-in write tools (`write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`, `multi_replace_file_content`) via `disabledTools`. (I learned the correct names by having agy dump its own tool list — the earlier guessed names never matched.) With writes disabled, agy's only path is `run_command → unityai` → **an approval card appears.**
3. I removed the yellow banner — it was lying now. agy goes through the approval gate just like Claude Code/Codex.

**A small remaining trade-off (in the spirit of honesty):** we can't disable `run_command` (we call `unityai` through it). So agy could theoretically bypass approval via raw shell; we only deter that with prompting. Claude Code & Codex load MCP natively, so for them the ban is **absolute**; for agy it isn't. An acceptable trade-off so agy can keep using unityMCP freely for scene control.

#### Lessons
1. **Embedding a CLI is categorically different from API integration** — a CLI is designed as an interactive user tool; driving it programmatically means forcing the wrong layer.
2. **When you consult an AI agent, verify** — agy said "it falls back on PIPE," which was wrong; Codex said the same. Agents don't remember their libraries' behavior, they guess.
3. **"It doesn't work" is an answer** — clear information (even if temporary) beats a fragile hack.
4. **Check GitHub Issues early** — Issue #187 was there on day one; I'd have saved 2 days.
5. **Document the dead ends** — that's what this section is for.

### Practical Rules (When Contributing)

1. **Write CLI configs at global scope** — headless mode usually doesn't read project-level config.
2. **Use a `strip()` comparison in the approval gate** — a trailing-newline diff opens an unnecessary card.
3. **Compare MCP tool names against the CLI's built-in list** — name collisions are silent.
4. **Split routes early** — any route file over 500 lines should be split; this was the most expensive debt.
5. **Scan upstream Issues before spawning a CLI as a subprocess.**
6. **Verify an AI agent's claims about its own libraries with an isolated test.**
